## Organizations on the DAT-Core

All SPARC investigators have access to the DAT-Core platform ([Blackfynn](https://app.blackfynn.io)). SPARC Investigators will have access to two organizations on the Blackfynn platform. 

1. **A private organization for their lab:** 
These accounts will should no longer be used for SPARC related efforts and will be transitioned to our standard free academic subscription model by March 2019 ([Blackfynn academic subscription](https://www.blackfynn.com/academia)). The private lab accounts were created for individual labs during the first year of the DAT-Core effort. However, starting in December 2018, all SPARC related data should be hosted in the **SPARC Confidential** organization. 

2. **The SPARC Confidential organization:** 
This organization will be used for all data submissions to the SPARC consortium. Investigators can create private datasets in this organization, and selectively share their dataset within this organization with other individuals or teams.  

For the remainder of the SPARC documenentation, any notion of organization on the DAT-Core will reference the **SPARC Consortium** organization only. 

### The SPARC Confidential organization on the DAT-Core

Since the SPARC Confidential organization will host all SPARC data (including embargoed data), access to to this organization will be restricted until users sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). User accounts to this organization will be managed by the DAT-CORE. By signing the NDA, SPARC awardees agree not to unilaterally publish or disseminate data made available from other labs and not to use data for commercial purposes during the embargo period. Once the users have signed the NDA, they will be granted access to the SPARC Consortium account. 

### SPARC Teams on the DAT-Core

Once users are accepted into the SPARC Consortium account, each investigator group can create a team. Initially, teams will reflect the individual laboratories, but it is possible to create any number of teams comprised of SPARC investigators (i.e. users with access to the SPARC Consortium Account). Teams will be used to set data access rights and roles for submitted datasets.

## SPARC Slack Organization

All SPARC investigators can join the SPARC [Slack Account](https://www.slack.com). SPARC uses Slack to foster collaboration and communication between investigators within the SPARC program. If you are interested to join the Slack account, send a message to Leonardo Guercio from the DAT-Core (support@blackfynn.com).
