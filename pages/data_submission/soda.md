## Overview

The idea for SODA emanated during the December 2018 SPARC Hackathon. It is a software intended to simplify the organization and submission process of SPARC datasets by handling complex and/or repetitive tasks through an intuitive and interactive interface. With SODA, users will be able to organize, generate metadata, validate, and submit datasets according to the SPARC Data Standards. SODA will be distributed as a desktop application for Windows, MAC OS, and Linux. It is currently under development and will be released progressively as features are incorporated. In October 2019, SODA will assist users in organizing their files/folders automatically, generating their metadata conveniently, and submitting their datasets to Blackfynn. In December 2019, users will be able to push and organize files/folders of a dataset directly on Blackfynn thus avoiding the need to create duplicate files locally. In February 2020, it will be possible to validate datasets using the validator developed by the Curation Team. In April 2020, users will be able to manipulate and annotate datasets on Blackfynn. In May 2020, SODA will permit to rapidly convert file format into a SPARC-defined standard format.
