## Make your protocol public on Protocols.io
The first step to making your data public is to make sure your protocols are made public on [Protocols.io](https://protocols.io). Follow the following steps:

1. Log into protocols.io, and make your datasetâ€™s protocol(s) published (orange publish button on the protocol will push the protocol from private to public)

2. Get a DOI for your protocol (there is a button on protocols.io for this as well)
3. Give the curators a couple of days to update your protocol URL to the DOI in your dataset_description file, or go ahead and do it yourself.

4. Update the URL to your protocols in the Blackfynn metadata record. 
5.  (Upon receiving confirmation that your dataset has been fully curated and is ready to publish,publish your data on the Blackfynn platform.


## Make your data public on Blackfynn
Publishing your Blackfynn datasets will make your data publicly available for everyone. The dataset will be findable and accessible on [Blackfynn Discover](https://discover.blackfynn.com) and the [SPARC Data portal](https://data.sparc.science).

1. Go to the dataset settings page.
2. Make sure the following information is correct:

- Dataset Title
- Dataset Describtion
- Dataset Contributors
- Dataset Tags
- Dataset License (select a CC-BY license)
- The Banner Image (.jpg or .png)

3. Click on "Publish to Blackfynn Discover". This will automatically request a Data Object Identifier (DOI) if you had not reserved one before. You can always publish an updated version of the dataset if needed at a later time, or un-publish a dataset if needed.
