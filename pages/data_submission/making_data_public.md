## Make your protocol public on Protocols.io
The first step to making your data public is to make sure your protocols are made public on [Protocols.io](https://protocols.io). Perform the following steps:

1. Log into protocols.io, and publish your datasetâ€™s protocol(s) by clicking the orange PUBLISH button.

2. Get a DOI for your protocol by clicking the orange GET DOI button.

3. Give the curators a couple days to update your protocol URL to the DOI in your dataset_description file, or go ahead and do it yourself.  To do it yourself, update the URL(s) to your protocol(s) by editing the Blackfynn "Protocol" metadata record.

4. Upon receiving confirmation that your dataset has been fully curated and is ready to publish, continue to the steps below.


## Using Blackfynn to make your data public
Publishing your Blackfynn datasets will make your data publicly available for the world to see. The dataset will be findable and accessible on [Blackfynn Discover](https://discover.blackfynn.com) and the [SPARC Portal](https://data.sparc.science).

1. Go to the dataset settings page in Blackfynn.

2. Make sure the following information is correct:

- Dataset Title
- Dataset Describtion
- Dataset Contributors
- Dataset Tags
- Dataset License (must select CC-BY license, per SPARC policy)
- The Banner Image (.jpg or .png)

3. Click on "Publish to Blackfynn Discover". This will automatically request a Data Object Identifier (DOI) if you had not reserved one before. You can always publish an updated version of the dataset if needed at a later time, or un-publish a dataset if needed.
