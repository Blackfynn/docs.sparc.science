## Introduction
The SPARC Data Core (DAT-Core) is implemented by Blackfynn Inc. [Blackfynn](https://www.blackfynn.com) develops cloud based solutions for data management and analysis for the Neurosciences. As part of the SPARC OT award, Blackfynn will develop functionality in their platform to support the SPARC data workflow. The platform is developed with sustainability in mind assuring that the DAT-Core platform will continue to be viable beyond the funding horizon of the SPARC program, and beyond the scope of the SPARC initiative. 

## Contact the DAT-Core
There are a number of ways to get in contact with the DAT-Core:

1. For all support questions about the platform, feedback, or bug reports, please use the "Get Help" button after logging into the platform to send the DAT-Core a message (see below). This is the best method to reach the DAT-Core development team, and will be prioritized within Blackfynn to guarantee a quick response. {% include image.html file="dat_core_help.png" alt="Get Help" max-width="200" %}

## Using Blackfynn outside of SPARC
SPARC investigators are allowed to use the Blackfynn platform to organize their own scientific data outside of the SPARC effort within their individual accounts. The individual accounts are limited to match the Blackfynn Academic subscription model ([Blackfynn Academia](https://www.blackfynn/academia)). Contact Blackfynn if you have any questions about Blackfynn Academia.
