## User accounts on the DAT-Core

All SPARC investigators have access to the DAT-Core platform ([Blackfynn](https://app.blackfynn.io)). SPARC Investigators will have access to two accounts on the Blackfynn platform. 

1. **A private account for their lab:** This account is available to the individual SPARC investigators and is independent of the SPARC requirements. Investigators can use this account for their data management needs within, and beyond the SPARC program. This account is private and not managed by the SPARC Consortium and has the same restrictions as a standard [Blackfynn academic subscription](https://www.blackfynn.com/academia)

2. **The SPARC Consortium account:** This account will be used for all data submissions to the SPARC consortium. This account will enforce strict data models and data submission processes. 

The remainder of the SPARC documenentation will reference the **SPARC Consortium organization** only. 

## Getting access to the SPARC Consortium account

Since the SPARC Consortium account will host all SPARC data (including embargoed data), access to to this organization will be restricted until users sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). User accounts to this organization will be managed by the DAT-CORE. By signing the NDA, SPARC awardees agree not to unilaterally publish or disseminate data made available from other labs and not to use data for commercial purposes during the embargo period. Once the users have signed the NDA, they will be granted access to the SPARC Consortium account. 

## SPARC Teams

Once users are accepted into the SPARC Consortium account, each investigator group can create a team. Initially, teams will reflect the individual laboratories, but it is possible to create any number of teams comprised of SPARC investigators (i.e. users with access to the SPARC Consortium Account). Teams will be used to set data access rights and roles for submitted datasets.
