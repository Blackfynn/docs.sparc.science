## Summary
This document outlines the SPARC milestones for the DAT-Core as outlined in the SPARC Notice of Award (NOA). It provides an outline of the functionality that will be developed for the DAT-Core platform as part of the SPARC effort. This document will be updated when changes to milestones occur. 

### Q1: October-December 2018

1. **Model, and dataset templates:** DAT-Core will implement functionality to create meta-data templates and use those templates to define a metadata structure for a dataset. 
2. **Support for linking model properties to other records:** The DAT-Core will provide the ability to define metadata models that contain properties that point to other records. This expands exisiting functionality to create relationships between records.
3. **Support for enumerated values, and multiple values in properties:** The DAT-Core will provide functionality to define properties in metadata models where users can only select from predefined values ('a dropdown menu'). This will expand functionality to standardize datasets.
4. **Support for uploading large files:** Based on user feedback, there is a need to upload very large files that take longer than 1 hour to upload per file. The DAT-Core will provide functionality to support this in a secure and performent way.
5. **Documentation for workflow, and platform:** The DAT-Core will provide extensive documentation around the data submission workflow and documentation of its platform.

### Q2: January-March 2019

1. **Expanding user permissions on datasets:** The DAT-Core will expand functionality for roles on datasets to support the SPARC data workflow.
2. **Expanded functionality for search over metadata:** The DAT-Core will expand functionality in their platform to search over metadata within datasets. 
3. **Support for dataset status:** Adding support for a status flag on datasets indicating the stage of curation it is in (draft, in-review, finalized)
4. **Support for N-dimensional imaging data:** The DAT-Core will expand functionality for 3D clinical imaging, and N-Dimensional microscopy imaging. 
5. **Improved tracking of SPARC data-use:** The DAT-Core will improve funcitonality to track how much data is contributed by SPARC investigators.

### Q3: April-June 2019

1. **Support for extracting header information from files:** DAT-Core will expand functionality to extract useful information from headers of files that are uploaded. 
2. **Launch of the Open Data Library:** The Open Data Library is a separate website where anyone can find and request access to public datasets shared on the DAT-Core. It is a webapplication that allows users of the DAT-Core platform to share their data publicly. Public datasets will receive a global DOI.
3. **Support for copyright and License information for public datasets:** Adding functionality for users to provide License and Copyright information to their datasets in preparation for make the data publicly available.
4. **Support for viewing Microsoft documents (if feasible):** The DAT-Core will implement a mechanism to better visualize Microsoft Office documents.
5. **Support for versioning of metadata:** The DAT-Core will provide an MVP for versioning of metadata on the platform.
6. **Deliver a MVP for the sparc data portal (data.sparc.science):** The DAT-Core, in collaboration with the other cores, will provide a separate web-application to visualize the integrated SPARC dataset. 

### Q4: July-September 2019

1. **Support for hierarchical ontologies:** The DAT-Core will expand functionality to link to ontologies and support for hierarchical ontologies. 
2. **Support for merging metadata from multiple datasets:** The DAT-Core will provide functionality to merge metadata between datasets.
3. **Expanded support for the Open Data Library:** DAT-Core will implement functionality to allow investigators outside the SPARC initiative, without a subscription to the DAT-Core platform, to access/download data from the Open Data Library in a sustainable way (cost for downloading data will be passed ot the downloader).


### SPARC Year 3
- **Focus on analysis:** The ability to run analysis on the cloud.
- **Focus on federated datasets:** The ability to store data remotely.
- **Focus on integration:** Integration with other platforms within, and beyond the SPARC DRC.
