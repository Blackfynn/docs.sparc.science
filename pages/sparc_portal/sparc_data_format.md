## Overview of SPARC Dataset Format

Each dataset dataset will comprise the following:
- A protocol that has been [submitted to Protocols.io]
- Data files organized in folders according to [SPARC guidelines](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EQPn1FmANpPsFt3CguU-JOQVMMlJsNXluQAK_gb2qVg/edit#slide=id.p1).  The SPARC Dataset Structure may be [downloaded as a zip file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mtZ5sL1lYcA2zHVsrYOKVeH2X-VlJT6P) or you may create them on your own. For help with working with the SPARC Dataset Structure, which is based on the [BIDS specification](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/), contact **sparc@neuinfo.org**.
- Metadata files and documentation organized according to the SPARC Dataset Structure.  Templates are provided in the zip file (docs file) and include the following:
  - [Submission metadata](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OhXmssY9GK8ebOmrvib1B9xbeqoVEOBA)
  - [Dataset description for publication](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VqBo63oKlxVdt8nNnbzVK0NxAHwc8-L/view?usp=sharing)
  - A representative figure that will be published along with the descriptive metadata
  - Experimental metadata specified by the SPARC Data Standards Committee based on the Minimal Information for a Neuroscience Dataset (MINDS) specification.  MINDS metadata fields have been incorporated into the [subjects](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IDo5INrqtIu1sTJW2mICzuGEAKqv5eGg) and [samples](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ROCsuBjMWBDmCTpTGZsUQDDgYtm-nqYG) templates available in the zip file.  An annotated list of these fields can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e61r3F2weausmBhqFK8RlYLviC3rya44so5m15mPRTw/edit#gid=108617967).
