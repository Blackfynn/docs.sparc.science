## Accessing public datasets on the SPARC portal
Users can get access to public datasets directly through the SPARC Portal. Datasets smaller than 5GB can be downloaded directly through the browser and all datasets can be accessed on Amazon's S3 service using your own AWS account. In order to access the public datasets, go to the `Browse Data` tab and select one of the datasets. Then, click on the `Get Dataset` button for information on where to get the specific dataset.
