## Introduction 

[MBF Bioscience](https://www.mbfbioscience.com/) presented a webinar demonstrating how to use several automated image segmentation tools in [Neurolucida 360](https://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida360) for qualitative and quantitative analysis. SPARC researchers can access organ and species-specific vocabulary terminology lists from the [SciCrunch](https://scicrunch.org/) ontology database for FAIR anatomical annotation in [Neurolucida 360](https://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida360), [Vesselucida 360](https://www.mbfbioscience.com/vesselucida360), and [Tissue Mapper](https://www.mbfbioscience.com/tissue-mapper). Representatives from the SPARC Data Curation team were available for questions after the demonstration.

In this webinar, you will learn how:
+ To use automated and semi-automated image segmentation tools in  [Neurolucida 360](https://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida360)
+ To obtain morphometric data from image segmentation files using [Neurolucida Explorer](https://www.mbfbioscience.com/neurolucida-explorer)
+ The latest [SPARC](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc) integrations in MBF software can make your data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by complying with the FAIR data principles
