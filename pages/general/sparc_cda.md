## Background

The SPARC project requires that recipients of certain awards share their proprietary data with the SPARC consortium. NIH, through the DAT-CORE, shall permit access to Confidential Information available in the DAT-CORE to an individual only if the individual has certified his or her agreement to comply with the terms of access set forth in the SPARC Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement. 

All Participants have the ability to share information of a proprietary and confidential nature on the Blackfynn Platform.  All Participants of the **SPARC Embargoed Data Sharing Group** can use the Blackfynn Platform to access proprietary and confidential information shared by other Participants. 

SPARC invesigators can only be included in the **SPARC Embargoed Data Sharing Group** after signing the SPARC Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement. A link to this agreement can be found below. The agreement formalizes the constraints around accessing proprietary embargoed SPARC data on the DAT-Core platform.

## Requesting access to the embargoed data
There are three steps involved in gaining access to embargoed data on the DAT-Core:

1. The user should already be a member of the **SPARC Consortium Organization** on the DAT-Core: platform. 
2. The user [downloads the CDA](https://s3.amazonaws.com/data.blackfynn.io/public-downloads/sparc/SPARC+DAT-CORE+Confidentiality+Disclosure+Agreement.pdf) and sends a signed copy to Leonardo Guercio (leonardo@blackfynn.com)
3. After verification of the request, the user is added to the **SPARC Embargoed Data Sharing Group**.
