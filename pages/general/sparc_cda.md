## Background

The SPARC program requires that recipients of certain awards share their data with the SPARC Consortium upon completion of milestones from which the data was generated (including pre-publication data). This data is considered to be embargoed before sharing with the public one year later. NIH, through the DAT-CORE, shall permit individuals to access such confidential information available in the DAT-CORE only if the individual has certified his or her agreement to comply with the terms of the SPARC Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement (CDA) and the [SPARC Material Sharing Policy](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc/materialsharing).

The CDA is designed to legally protect investigators who are sharing pre-publication data. By signing the agreement, you agree not to unilaterally publish or publicly disclose others' embargoed data or use them for commercial purposes without a license. A link to this agreement can be found below.

## Requesting access to the embargoed data
There are three steps involved in gaining access to embargoed data on the DAT-Core:

1. The user should already be a member of the **SPARC Consortium Organization** on the DAT-CORE platform. 
2. The user [downloads the CDA](https://s3.amazonaws.com/data.blackfynn.io/public-downloads/sparc/SPARC+DAT-CORE+Confidentiality+Disclosure+Agreement.pdf), signs and scans the document, and emails a signed copy to Leonardo Guercio from the DAT-CORE (leonardo@blackfynn.com). The DAT-CORE will maintain a copy of all signed SPARC CDAs. A list of SPARC investigators who have signed the CDA can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZk4F0W6UpZWTFFMze722ualNI6S_Z0_mj8D8wyaf04/edit#gid=0).
3. After verification of the request, the user is added to the **SPARC Embargoed Data Sharing Group** team.
