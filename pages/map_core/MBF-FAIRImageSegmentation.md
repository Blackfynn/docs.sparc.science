SPARC investigators have access to curated anatomical terminology
databases in MBF Bioscience software for comprehensive, FAIR (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) anatomical mapping specific to
each organ and species of interest.

### What is FAIR data?

 FINDABLE: rich metadata with explicit data identifiers that are
 searchable in a registry or index

 ACCESIBLE: open protocols with unique identifiers, metadata available
 even after data is not

 INTEROPERABLE: Â represent knowledge with FAIR approved terminology

 REUSABLE: sustainable metadata that complies with SPARC data sharing
 standards

### What are the anatomical terminology databases?

 These are databases that house vocabularies such as anatomical
 ontologies and reference atlas terminologies so that they can be used
 and managed by SPARC. Vocabularies from the anatomical terminology
 databases are used during mapping, segmentation and annotation to
 produce FAIR data that will carry through the MAP-CORE pipeline.

### What do I do with the anatomical terminology lists?

 Make your SPARC data interoperable. Utilize the anatomical terminology
 lists while mapping your organ to ensure the names of the structures
 segmented are recognized by both humans and computers.

### What are Vocabulary Services?

 Vocabulary Services refers to the databases and infrastructure for
 serving and managing terminology for SPARC. The vocabulary services
 allow MBF Bioscience users to select from shared vocabularies for
 annotating their data and add new terms where necessary.

### Who curates the databases?

 The FAIR Data Informatics lab (FDI) at the University of San Diego,
 part of the SPARC Data Curation team, is building each anatomical
 terminology list from vocabulary services using their SciGraph and
 Interlex platforms. SciGraph is a graph database that provides an API
 (programmatic interface) to the SPARC vocabularies; Interlex is a
 dynamic platform that allows SPARC users to edit and add terms. Once
 terms are approved by SPARC, they are added to SciGraph so they can be
 used by others.

### Who curates the data we've created after using the database terminology

 SPARC Data Curation team.

### Who do I contact if I have a new term?

 The SPARC Data Curation team. Submit a new term in MBF Bioscience
 software by clicking the **REQUEST A NEW TERM** button in the Contour
 Selection panel to launch the submission form on the SciCrunch
 website.

### Who do I contact if I don't agree with the terminology?

 To request access to a particular atlas or have SPARC specific
 questions, communicate with the SPARC Data Curation team. Start a
 discussion in the [\#mapcore-support](https://nih-sparc.slack.com/archives/CEHRL6QH1) channel on the NIH SPARC \#Slack.
